The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) drive Enlightenment, but they
can also be used independently or built on top of one other to provide useful
features and create powerful applications. The core EFL libraries are much
more efficient in both speed and size than their GTK+ and Qt equivalents,
and have a smaller memory footprint.
